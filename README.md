Welcome to my portfolio!

This is still a work in progress, but this is where I will be showcasing my projects and skills as they continue to improve.

Currently, I have one of my projects linked and the rest of my portfolio is placeholders until I have completed this course and have the skills I need
to fill up a full portfolio.

I combined many elements that I have learned so far in the first few weeks of my coding class to bring this together. I don't believe it is
anywhere near fully complete, but it is a solid foundation to build off of.

Here is a working URL for my portfolio: https://connermtodd.github.io/ConnerToddsPortfolio/
